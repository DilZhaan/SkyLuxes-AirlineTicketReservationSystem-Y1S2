## Future Improvements

As we continue to evolve our system, we're always looking for ways to enhance the user experience and optimize performance. Here's what's on our roadmap for upcoming improvements:

### Seamless Content Integration (Dilshan Yapa)
At the moment, users navigate through legal menus and dashboards on separate pages. My goal is to make the user experience smoother by integrating content directly within the same page. This change will eliminate unnecessary page loads, making the system more intuitive and user-friendly.

### Docker Container Implementation (Dilshan Yapa)
I'm considering leveraging Docker containers to optimize deployment and scalability. By encapsulating the application and its dependencies, I aim to simplify deployment processes and ensure consistent performance across different environments. This approach will not only streamline deployment but also make it easier to manage and scale the project as it grows.
